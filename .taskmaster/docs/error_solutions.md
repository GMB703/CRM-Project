# CRM Project Error Solutions Log

## Error 1: Server startup failing due to missing users.js
- **Error**: Cannot find module '/server/src/routes/users.js' imported from /server/src/index.js
- **Root Cause**: The server's index.js was trying to import a non-existent users.js route file, while all user-related functionality is actually handled in auth.js
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verified that user routes are properly handled in auth.js
  2. Removed incorrect users.js import from index.js
  3. Ensured server restarts cleanly without the missing module error
- **Prevention**: 
  - Always check route imports against actual file structure
  - Keep route organization documentation up to date
  - User-related routes should be managed through auth.js
- **Fixed in**: server/src/index.js
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved - Server now starts successfully

## Error 2: Login endpoint switching issue
- **Error**: Endpoint switching between /auth/login and /login
- **Root Cause**: API_BASE_URL mismatch between client and server
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verified that client's Vite config already has correct proxy setup for /api routes
  2. No .env file needed as proxy configuration handles the routing
- **Fixed in**: client/vite.config.js
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Error 3: Organization endpoint connection errors
- **Error**: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error) on /api/organizations/current
- **Root Cause**: OrganizationContext was trying to load organization data on mount, regardless of authentication state
- **Solution**:
  1. Removed unconditional loadOrganizationData call on mount in OrganizationContext
  2. Kept the conditional load that only runs when user is authenticated and has a valid token
  3. This prevents unauthorized API calls and 500 errors before login
- **Prevention**:
  - Always check authentication state before making authenticated API calls
  - Use React's useEffect dependencies to properly control when API calls are made
  - Handle loading and error states appropriately in the UI
- **Fixed in**: client/src/contexts/OrganizationContext.jsx
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Current Status
- All identified errors have been resolved
- Server and client are now running correctly
- Authentication and organization context are properly synchronized

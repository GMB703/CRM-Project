# Overview  
The CRM project currently has a multi-tenant database schema designed with Organization entities but lacks the complete implementation. This PRD outlines the implementation of full multi-tenant functionality to allow multiple construction/remodeling companies to use the same CRM system while maintaining complete data isolation between organizations.

The system will support:
- Multiple organizations using the same platform
- Complete data isolation between tenants
- Organization-specific branding and settings
- User management within organization boundaries
- Seamless organization context switching for admin users

# Core Features  
## 1. Organization Management
- Organization registration and setup
- Organization settings and branding customization
- Organization status management (active/inactive)
- Organization-specific configuration

## 2. Multi-Tenant Authentication
- Organization-aware user authentication
- Organization context establishment during login
- JWT tokens with organization claims
- Organization-specific user roles and permissions

## 3. Data Isolation
- All database queries filtered by organizationId
- API endpoints enforcing organization boundaries
- File storage organized by organization
- Communication features scoped to organization

## 4. Organization Context Management
- Frontend organization context provider
- Organization switching for super-admin users
- Organization-specific navigation and features
- Organization branding in UI

## 5. Seed Data and Migration
- Organization-aware database seeding
- Migration scripts for existing data
- Test data for multiple organizations

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- **Super Admin**: Can manage multiple organizations, switch contexts
- **Organization Admin**: Manages users and settings within their organization
- **Organization Users**: Access features within their organization scope
- **New Organization Owner**: Sets up and configures their organization

## Key User Flows
1. **Organization Registration**: New organization signup with initial admin user
2. **User Login**: Organization-aware authentication with context establishment
3. **Organization Setup**: Initial configuration, branding, and user invitation
4. **Daily Usage**: All CRM features working within organization boundaries
5. **Organization Management**: Admin managing organization settings and users

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Organization Service**: Handles organization CRUD operations
- **Multi-Tenant Middleware**: Enforces organization context in all requests
- **Authentication Service**: Enhanced with organization-aware login
- **Database Layer**: All queries include organizationId filtering
- **Frontend Context**: React context for organization state management

## Data Models
- Organization model (already exists in schema)
- Enhanced User model with organization relationships
- All existing models already have organizationId foreign keys
- Organization-specific settings and branding models

## APIs and Integrations
- Organization management endpoints
- Enhanced authentication endpoints with organization context
- All existing endpoints modified to include organization filtering
- Organization invitation and user management APIs

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Database migrations for organization seeding
- File storage organization by tenant
- Environment configuration for multi-tenant setup
- Logging and monitoring per organization

# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Fix database seed file to create organizations
- Implement organization-aware authentication
- Create organization context middleware for backend
- Basic organization management API endpoints

## Phase 2: Backend Multi-Tenant Implementation
- Update all existing route handlers to filter by organizationId
- Implement organization management endpoints
- Add organization-specific file storage
- Update communication features for organization scope

## Phase 3: Frontend Multi-Tenant Implementation
- Create organization context provider in React
- Update authentication flow to handle organization context
- Modify all API calls to include organization context
- Implement organization switching for admin users

## Phase 4: Organization Management UI
- Organization registration/setup flow
- Organization settings and branding UI
- User invitation and management within organization
- Organization dashboard and analytics

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features
- Organization-specific branding and theming
- Advanced organization settings
- Organization usage analytics and billing preparation
- Multi-organization user support for service providers

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Database Foundation**: Fix seed file and create organization data structure
2. **Authentication Enhancement**: Update auth to handle organization context
3. **Backend Data Isolation**: Implement organizationId filtering in all routes
4. **Frontend Context**: Establish organization context in React app
5. **API Integration**: Update frontend to use organization-aware APIs
6. **User Interface**: Build organization management and switching UI
7. **Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing with multiple organizations

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Complex data migration for existing data
- **Mitigation**: Start with fresh database, implement migration scripts incrementally

- **Risk**: Performance impact of organizationId filtering
- **Mitigation**: Proper database indexing and query optimization

- **Risk**: Frontend state management complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use React Context with proper error boundaries and loading states

## MVP Scope Management
- **Risk**: Feature creep during implementation
- **Mitigation**: Focus on core multi-tenancy first, defer advanced features

- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Implement feature flags and gradual rollout

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Large scope affecting development timeline
- **Mitigation**: Phased approach with working MVP after each phase

# Appendix  
## Technical Specifications
- JWT tokens will include organizationId claim
- All Prisma queries will include organizationId in where clauses
- React Context will manage current organization state
- File uploads will be organized in organization-specific folders
- Database indexes on organizationId for all major tables

## Research Findings
- Current schema already supports multi-tenancy
- Seed file needs complete rewrite to include organizations
- Communication features (Socket.IO) need organization room management
- All existing routes need organizationId filtering implementation

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility during development
- Use TypeScript for better type safety with organization context
- Implement comprehensive error handling for organization-related errors
- Add logging for organization context and access patterns

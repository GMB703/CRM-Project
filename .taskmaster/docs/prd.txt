# CRM Project - Future Enhancements PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the CRM system, focusing on expanding the estimate system functionality and adding new features to improve user experience, client engagement, and business operations.

## 1. Catalog Management

### Problem Statement
Users currently need to manually enter product and service details for each estimate, leading to inconsistencies, errors, and time inefficiency.

### Solution

- Search and filtering capabilities
- Image support for visual products
- Price history tracking

### Success Criteria
- Reduction in estimate creation time by 30%
- Improved consistency across estimates
- Positive user feedback on catalog usability

## 2. Estimate Templates

### Problem Statement

### Solution
Create a template system that allows saving and reusing estimate structures, including line items, terms, and configurations.

### Requirements
- Save existing estimates as templates
- Template categories for organization
- Template versioning
- Default terms and conditions by template
- Quick-start new estimates from templates
- Template sharing within organization

### Success Criteria

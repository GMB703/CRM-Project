			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase Transaction Pooler configuration task into subtasks covering: 1) Connection string analysis and formatting, 2) Environment configuration updates, 3) Connection pooling implementation, 4) Error handling and retry logic, and 5) Testing and verification. For each subtask, include specific technical requirements, potential challenges, and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves database configuration with several technical components including connection string formatting, SSL settings, connection pooling, error handling, and proper security practices. The complexity is moderate (6/10) because while it requires specific technical knowledge of Supabase and database connections, the scope is well-defined with clear steps. The task requires careful implementation and testing to ensure database reliability but doesn't involve complex algorithms or system architecture changes. Five subtasks would effectively organize the work into logical components covering connection string configuration, environment updates, pooling implementation, error handling, and comprehensive testing."

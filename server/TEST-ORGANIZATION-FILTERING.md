# Organization Filtering Test Guide

This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for the multi-tenant organization filtering functionality implemented in the CRM system.

## Overview

The organization filtering system ensures complete data isolation between different organizations using the same CRM instance. This is critical for security, privacy, and compliance in multi-tenant environments.

## Test Coverage

Our test suite covers the following areas:

### 1. Authentication & Organization Context
- âœ… JWT tokens contain organization context
- âœ… Organization-aware login/registration
- âœ… Token validation with organization data

### 2. Route Handler Organization Filtering
- âœ… Chat message routes with organization isolation
- âœ… Project access validation
- âœ… Cross-organization access prevention
- âœ… File upload organization scoping

### 3. Error Handling
- âœ… Organization-specific error responses
- âœ… Proper HTTP status codes
- âœ… Missing organization context handling
- âœ… Invalid organization access attempts

### 4. Data Isolation
- âœ… Complete separation of organization data
- âœ… No cross-contamination between organizations
- âœ… Organization-scoped database queries
- âœ… Message filtering by organization

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Database Setup**: Ensure your database is running and accessible
2. **Server Running**: The API server should be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or set `TEST_BASE_URL` environment variable)
3. **Dependencies**: Install required packages:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install axios
   ```

### Running the Automated Test Suite

```bash
# From the server directory
node test-organization-filtering.js
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize the test environment with these variables:

```bash
# Set custom API base URL
TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 node test-organization-filtering.js

# Set custom database URL (if needed)
DATABASE_URL=your_test_database_url node test-organization-filtering.js
```

### Expected Output

Successful test run should show:

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Organization Registration & Login

1. **Register User A in Organization A**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "user-a@example.com",
       "firstName": "User",
       "lastName": "A",
       "password": "TestPassword123!",
       "organizationId": "org-a-id"
     }'
   ```

2. **Register User B in Organization B**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "user-b@example.com",
       "firstName": "User",
       "lastName": "B", 
       "password": "TestPassword123!",
       "organizationId": "org-b-id"
     }'
   ```

3. **Verify Login Returns Organization Context**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "user-a@example.com",
       "password": "TestPassword123!"
     }'
   ```

### Test Case 2: Chat Message Organization Isolation

1. **Send Message as User A**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat/messages \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-a-token>" \
     -H "X-Organization-ID: <org-a-id>" \
     -d '{
       "content": "Message from Org A",
       "projectId": "<project-a-id>",
       "type": "TEXT"
     }'
   ```

2. **Try to Access Messages as User B** (should fail):
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/chat/messages/<project-a-id> \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-b-token>" \
     -H "X-Organization-ID: <org-b-id>"
   ```

3. **Verify Error Response**:
   Expected: `404 Not Found` with organization access denied message

### Test Case 3: Error Handling

1. **Request Without Organization Context**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/chat/messages/<project-id> \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
   ```
   Expected: `400 Bad Request` - Missing organization context

2. **Request with Invalid Organization**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/chat/messages/<project-id> \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "X-Organization-ID: invalid-org-id"
   ```
   Expected: `404 Not Found` - Organization not found

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests Fail with Database Connection Error**:
   - Verify database is running
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file
   - Ensure database schema is up to date

2. **Tests Fail with API Connection Error**:
   - Verify server is running on expected port
   - Check `TEST_BASE_URL` environment variable
   - Ensure all required middleware is loaded

3. **Authentication Tests Fail**:
   - Verify JWT secret is configured
   - Check organization middleware is properly loaded
   - Ensure database has organization records

4. **Data Isolation Tests Fail**:
   - Check database service organization filtering
   - Verify middleware is applying organization context
   - Review route handler organization checks

### Debug Mode

Run tests with additional debugging:

```bash
DEBUG=1 node test-organization-filtering.js
```

This will provide more detailed output for troubleshooting failed tests.

## Security Considerations

### What the Tests Verify

- âœ… **No Cross-Organization Data Access**: Users cannot access data from other organizations
- âœ… **Proper Error Messages**: Error responses don't leak sensitive information
- âœ… **Token Validation**: JWT tokens are properly validated with organization context
- âœ… **Database Isolation**: All database queries are organization-scoped
- âœ… **Route Protection**: All routes require proper organization context

### What to Monitor

- **Failed Login Attempts**: Monitor for attempts to access other organizations
- **Cross-Organization Requests**: Log and alert on attempts to access other org data
- **Token Manipulation**: Watch for modified or invalid organization tokens
- **Database Query Patterns**: Ensure all queries include organization filtering

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Organization Filtering Tests
  run: |
    cd server
    npm install
    node test-organization-filtering.js
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.TEST_DATABASE_URL }}
    TEST_BASE_URL: http://localhost:5000
```

## Conclusion

The organization filtering system provides robust multi-tenant data isolation. Regular testing ensures the security and integrity of the system as new features are added.

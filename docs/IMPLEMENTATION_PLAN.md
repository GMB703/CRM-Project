# CRM Project - Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction & Goals

This document provides a consolidated, actionable implementation plan for the CRM project. It merges the high-level goals from `ROADMAP.md` and the detailed enhancements from `CRM_ENHANCEMENTS.md` into a single, prioritized guide.

Our primary goals are to:
- **Stabilize** the existing feature set, ensuring all current functionality is bug-free and reliable.
- **Enhance** the core CRM capabilities with robust Lead Management and Communication tools.
- **Expand** the platform with Advanced Analytics, Reporting, and Payment processing.
- **Deliver** a world-class client experience with a secure Client Portal and Document Management system.

## 2. Development Phases

This plan is broken down into four distinct phases, designed to deliver value incrementally and allow for feedback and adjustments.

### **Phase 1: Stabilization & Super Admin Enhancements (Current Phase)**

**Objective:** Solidify the application's foundation, resolve all existing bugs, and deliver a seamless experience for Super Admins.

| Task ID | Feature | Status | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ST-01** | **Fix User/Organization Data Mismatch:** Resolve the filtering and context-switching issues in the Super Admin dashboard. | `In Progress` | `Critical` |
| **ST-02** | **Full End-to-End Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing on all existing features, including auth, roles, and CRUD operations. | `Pending` | `High` |
| **ST-03** | **Refactor API Calls:** Ensure all frontend API calls use the correct endpoints and data handling logic (e.g., `super-admin` routes). | `In Progress` | `High` |
| **ST-04** | **Consolidate Documentation:** Deprecate `ROADMAP.md` and `CRM_ENHANCEMENTS.md` in favor of this plan. | `Completed` | `Medium` |

## 3. Technology & Principles

- **Stack:** We will continue to use our existing stack: React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma.
- **State Management:** Redux for global state, React Context for localized/UI state.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **API:** All new endpoints will follow our established RESTful patterns and use existing authentication/authorization middleware.
- **Testing:** New features must be accompanied by relevant unit and integration tests.
- **CI/CD:** To be discussed and implemented.

This plan is a living document and will be updated as we complete each phase. Next, I will return to Phase 1 and resolve the critical bug in the Super Admin dashboard.

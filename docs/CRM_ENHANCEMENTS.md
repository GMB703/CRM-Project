# CRM Software Enhancements - Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive CRM enhancements that will build upon the existing customer management system, integrating seamlessly with current estimates and projects modules using our existing React/Node.js/PostgreSQL stack.

## Current Architecture Assessment
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS ✅
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express ✅  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM ✅
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with multi-tenant support ✅
- **Existing Modules**: Customers, Projects, Estimates ✅

## Implementation Strategy
All enhancements will:
- Build upon existing database schema (extend, don't replace)
- Use current authentication and organization isolation
- Maintain existing UI/UX patterns
- Leverage existing API patterns and middleware
- No conflicting dependencies or major architectural changes
